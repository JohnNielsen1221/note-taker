## General info
This app will allow you to write personal notes and allow you to save them in a database for future use.

## Functionality
After clicking on "Get Started" button on the homepage, you will be directed to your notes page. This page will contain any notes that you have written in the past and have not deleted. You are then able to add new notes by typing in a Note Title and Note Text, which will cause a Save icon to appear in the top right corner, allowing you to save your note to the list on the leeft side of the page. You can click on any note in that list to make it appear in the main section of the page, and you can click on the trash can icon to delete any note. If you are currently viewing a saved note, you will need to click on the pencil icon in the top right corner if you wish to create a new note.

## Status
Project is: _complete_ (for now)
